Steps of crfeating LTE Network:

1. Setting up LTE Network:
   - Create nodes and provide them to with the methods to add eNodeBs and UEs.
   - Configure those nodes as a set of eNodes and another set of UEs.
   - Install LTE protocol on top of them. Note. they are still empty nodes.
   - Configure mobility model for all nodes by setting up the position of the nodes using the "SetPositionAllocator" method of the mobility model.
   - Assign locations to the nodes in a shape of a grid inside the cell by declaring the number of required rows and columnsin the grid, and by declaring the gap between any two consecutive nodes.
   - Attach all UEs to one eNodeBs, By doing that we can configure each UE node in line with the configuration of the eNodeBs.
   - Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection is established between each UE node and eNodeBs.
2. Memic traffic in LTE Network:
   - Activating data radio bearer between each UE node and the eNodeBs it is connected to, to know which region of the LTE network has the maximum amount of traffic.
   - Two saturation traffic genrators are being activated one for uplink communication and the second for downlink communication.
   - In the Example we can see the generated traffic of the communication between UEs and eNodeBs in form of circles, the higher the density of concentric circles in a given region the higher the traffic in that region.
3. Handover scenario:
   - To tasks needs to be done to create this scenario:
     1. get notified when a connection between the UE and the eNodesBs is established.
     2. get notified when handover of a UE node starts and when the hadover ends
   - Three functions were created for the pupose of doing those tasks.
   - The handover starts when the UE node starts receiving signals of better signal strength from eNodeB other than the one which was being served.
4. Testing:
   - Delay(end-to-end mean delay)
   - Throuphput
   - Packet loss ratio
   - testing was done using the flow-monitor package in NS3 by installing a single flow-monitor over all nodes in the network.
